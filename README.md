# PyCataloguer

PyCataloguer is universal cataloguer for your files. You can organaze books, videos, music on your computer. You can copy files, database and source code on another computer and you need only replace some absolute paths in the database!

The programm has command line interface. I wiil be very happy, if you will make GUI for it!

The programm doesn't remove, replace or rename origing files on your computer. Only add path to origin file into own database.

# Roadmap

- [x] files - adding, deleting, viewing.
- [x] paths, where PyCataloguer search the files - adding, deleting, viewing.
- [x] import/export sql dump of database
- [ ] categories - adding, deliting, parenting (tree of categories)
- [ ] categories - adding files to categories
- [ ] files - open via standart software
- [ ] files - scan directories and adding new files
- [ ] files - scan directories and search replaced files (by md5-hash)

# Ideal Roadmap

- [ ] - adding file to the database, by selecting item from context menu of your favourite file manager (on Linux, Mac, Windows)
- [ ] - open files from the programm in standart software

I hope PyCataloguer will help you! :)
